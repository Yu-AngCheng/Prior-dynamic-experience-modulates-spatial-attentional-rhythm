**ABSTRACT**

The brain efficiently directs its limited resources over multiple objects through a mechanism called attention. Recent studies show that attention works in a temporally dynamic way, where resources are allocated rhythmically upon multiple objects. However, little is known about its flexibility, whether the rhythm is hardwired inherently or can adapt to different task demands. Here we used human behavioral data to investigate this characteristic. We presented a rhythmic stimulus alternating between two locations before asking participants (N = 25) to detect a target between these two locations. We successfully verified that before the priming stimulus, detection performance, reflecting the spatial attention frequency, fluctuates rhythmically at ~2.5Hz. More importantly, this rhythm will be impacted by the temporal dynamics of the priming stimulus. The spatial attention frequency is ~4.5Hz among people exposed to a 5Hz prime stimulus, while it is still ~2.5Hz among those exposed to a 3Hz prime stimulus. Yet, the spatial attention frequencies of these two groups of people do not differ before exposure to the rhythmic stimulus. Therefore, these findings suggest that visual spatial attention is a highly adaptive system, which automatically organizes itself to adapt to the temporal dynamics of external stimuli, so as to process external information at an appropriate time scale.
