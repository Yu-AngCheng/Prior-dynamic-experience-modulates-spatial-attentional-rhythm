%===================
function design = fullfact(levels)
%FULLFACT Mixed-level full-factorial designs.
%   DESIGN=FULLFACT(LEVELS) creates a matrix DESIGN containing the
%   factor settings for a full factorial design. The vector LEVELS
%   specifies the number of unique settings in each column of the design.
%
%   Example:
%       LEVELS = [2 4 3];
%       DESIGN = FULLFACT(LEVELS);
%   This generates a 24 run design with 2 levels in the first column,
%   4 in the second column, and 3 in the third column.
